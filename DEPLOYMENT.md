# YouTube App Deployment Guide

## Issues Fixed:

1. **Environment Variables**: 
   - Moved API key to `.env` file for security
   - Added fallback for when environment variable is not set

2. **Error Handling**: 
   - Added try-catch blocks in API calls
   - Added error states in components
   - Improved loading states

3. **Vercel Configuration**: 
   - Updated `vercel.json` for better SPA routing

4. **Component Safety**: 
   - Added null checks for data
   - Better handling of empty video arrays
   - Improved fallback UI

## Deployment Steps for Vercel:

1. **Set Environment Variable in Vercel**:
   - Go to your Vercel project dashboard
   - Navigate to Settings â†’ Environment Variables
   - Add: `VITE_RAPIDAPI_KEY` with value: `ca90a6db1cmsh82f3e7dead0ecb1p18d8dbjsn45fffd5d914b`

2. **Deploy**:
   - Push your changes to GitHub
   - Vercel will automatically redeploy

## Local Development:

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run development server: `npm run dev`
3. Build for production: `npm run build`

## Security Note:

Consider getting a new RapidAPI key from YouTube v3 API since the current one is exposed in the public repository. Update the environment variable with the new key.
